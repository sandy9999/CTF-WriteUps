We are given an encoded text resembling Morse Code. But turns out it's not really that. There is a mention of "bacon" in the question which hints at bacon cipher. So just replace dots with As and dashes with Bs (or vice versa, I forgot the order), and decode using Bacon cipher.

```
rtcp{bacon_but_grilled_and_morsified}
